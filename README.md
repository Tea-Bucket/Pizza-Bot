# PizzaBot
This is a website we built for our board game nights. It replaces an older website with similar base functionality and improves on it.

## Website
The website is built using C# and ASP.NET. Being new to ASP.NET the code quality is naturally quite bad.

## Data
The main data is stored in a MySQL database and interfaced with using EF core. Other data, like configurations and logs are saved in text files.
